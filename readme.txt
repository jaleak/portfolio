This program creates logs for nutrition.
Multiple logs can be made denoting various user's logs.
Please follow the instructions provided when opening the program.
To start the program, run with an argument of a data file you would like to work from.
In the case given, I used the food_nutrient_data.csv file given.
Portions of code were borrowed from Dr. Lusth such as the scanner files and the framework for the rbt/gst/bst/tnode files (.h files), but the implementation (.c files) were completed by myself.
In order to insert/search/delete foods from logs, please use the EXACT food names given in the data file, using quotations to denote the food being searched.
For example: when searching for MOCHI ICE CREAM BONBONS, in the monica.log, the command would look like:search "MOCHI ICE CREAM BONBONS" monica.log
Different logs are saved in csv files, but can be accessed through the program.
